</P>
<BR>
<h2>What do you do to maintain your technical certifications?</h2>
<P>This differs for every certification you get. Some certificates will require you to keep getting educated to maintain them, whereas others do not need you to do anything. Once you have received the latter, you will not be required to do anything to keep the certification. For the former, you will have to study and take exams after a specified period to maintain the certification. The goal of this high-frequency training is to ensure that professionals keep pursuing professional development and learning about the changes in their industry. Despite being highly demanding, it is a useful tool that enables individuals to pursue their profession for years without being irrelevant.

In essence, the certificates help you get a higher salary since employers consider you to be someone who is committed to becoming a better professional.</P>

<h2>How is your education helping you prepare for the job market?</h2>
<P> My college education has exceptionally prepared me for a smooth transition from school to work by providing me with the skills necessary to succeed. On my first internship- I honed in on my marketing skills by developing useful strategies with a team. This experience has also helped to develop my communication skills- as I was required to work with others to create solutions. I feel that the experience I gained was truly valuable- as it has prepared me for my successful marketing career thus far. During my education- I additionally became fluent in Spanish and French- allowing me to communicate with a broader variety of people.</P>
<BR>
  <h2>How would you rate your key competencies for this job?</h2>
<P>‘When I first started my current role, I quickly discovered that we had a recurring difficulty in getting new client reports signed off in a timely fashion. I asked around the team, and found out that every asset had to be personally approved by a particular director. This man was perceived to be quite intimidating and was never very available, so we were constantly on the backfoot with deadlines.</P>
<BR>
<h2> What are your IT strengths and weaknesses?</h2>
<P> Whenever new software is released, I’m always the first one to test and get familiar with it. I love pushing the edge and learning every aspect of the new software. In fact, just last week I found a software issue with one of my video games. I called the developer, and they fixed it right away. This position will give me the opportunity to apply my passion and help make programs better for your company. </P>
<P> I tend to be overly critical of myself. Whenever I complete a project, I can’t help but feel that I could have done more even if my work received a positive response. This often leads me to overwork myself and leaves me feeling burned out. Over the past few years, I’ve tried to take time to look at my achievements objectively and celebrate those wins. This has not only improved my work and my confidence, but it has helped me to appreciate my team and other support systems that are always behind me in everything I do. </P>
   <h2>Tell me about the most recent project you worked on. What were your responsibilities?</h2>
<P>"I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. What's really crucial for me when starting one is to get very clear on the goals right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I also like dealing with the most difficult parts of the projects early on—that way in case there are any significant issues, I'll still have a nice amount of time to complete before the deadline. I also typically break down large tasks into smaller chunks, so that it is easier to know where to start. Detailed planning is very important to ensure an important project goes smoothly. For example, last year I was in charge of . . . ."

From here, start explaining the project, first in terms of its purpose and objective, scope, complexity [e.g. working with new technology, number of resources, budget, and timeline] and the key challenge you needed to overcome. Show them that you can see not only the big picture but also all the little things that need to happen on a daily basis in order to get the project done. Here's another example of how to answer the question:</P>
<h2> What challenges do you think you might expect in this job if you were hired?</h2>
<P>I hope to be challenged intellectually with tough programming puzzles, and with writing code that I have never written before. I enjoy to work on innovative things, and to devise my own way of solving different problems in application design and functionality. Your company works on many interesting mobile apps, unique products on the mobile market. I am sure that such work will be challenging enough to motivate me, and to help me grow as a programmer.</P>
<h2>How important is it to work directly with your business users?</h2>
<P>t is extremely important to work directly with your business users to deeply understand their requirements, pain points, and preferences. This relationship assumes even more significance if the business is related to providing continuous service to the client such as legal, consulting, marketing services, etc.

Working directly with the business users without any third parties in between also eliminates the chances the miscommunication and wrong perception/expectation on different deliverables, thus helping both the clienta and the vendors to achieve efficiency.</P>
